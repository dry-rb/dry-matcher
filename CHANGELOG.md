[Compare v0.8.3...v0.9.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.8.3...v0.9.0)

## 0.8.3 2020-01-07


### Fixed

- Delegation warnings about keyword arguments (flash-gordon)


[Compare v0.8.2...v0.8.3](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.8.2...v0.8.3)

## 0.8.2 2019-09-06


### Fixed

- Minimal dry-core version set to 0.4.8 (flash-gordon)


[Compare v0.8.1...v0.8.2](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2)

## 0.8.1 2019-08-13


### Added

- `Dry::Matcher#for` is a shortcut for `Dry::Matcher.for(..., with: matcher)` (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
  require 'dry/matcher/result_matcher'

  class CreateUser
    include Dry::Matcher::ResultMatcher.for(:call)

    def call(...)
      # code returning an instance of Dry::Monads::Result
    end
  end
  ```


[Compare v0.8.0...v0.8.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1)

## 0.8.0 2019-07-30


### Added

- API for cases was changed to work with a single block instead of `match`/`resolve` combination (flash-gordon in [#23](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/23)):
  ```ruby
  Dry::Matcher::Case.new do |value, patterns|
    if patterns.include?(value)
      # value will be passed to the block
      value
     else
       # Undefined stands for no match
       Dry::Matcher::Undefined
    end
  end
  ```
- `ResultMatcher` now uses patterns for matching and matches against the first element if an array is passed (flash-gordon in [#24](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/24) and [#22](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/22) and michaelherold in [#21](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/21))

  ```ruby
  value = Dry::Monads::Result::Failure.new([:invalid, :reasons])

  Dry::Matcher::ResultMatcher.(value) do |m|
    m.success do |v|
      "Yay: #{v}"
    end

    m.failure(:not_found) do
      "No such thing"
    end

    m.failure(:invalid) do |_code, errors|
      "Cannot be done: #{errors.inspect}"
    end
  end #=> "Cannot be done: :reasons"
  ```

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Support for Ruby 2.3 was dropped as it's EOL

[Compare v0.7.0...v0.8.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0)

## 0.7.0 2018-01-11


### Changed

- `EitherMatcher` was renamed to `ResultMatcher` according to match the rename of `Either` to `Result` in dry-monads 0.4.0. The previous name is still there for backward compatibility, we'll deprecate and drop it in furure releases (flash-gordon in [#13](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/13))

[Compare v0.6.0...v0.7.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0)

## 0.6.0 2016-12-19


### Added

- API documentation for most methods (alsemyonov in [#8](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/8))

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of calls to non-existent cases within a matcher block (timriley)

### Changed

- Matches must now be exhaustive - when matching against a value, at least one match block must be provided for each of a matcher's cases (timriley in [#7](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/7))
- `Dry::Matcher::Case` objects can now be created without a `resolve:` proc. In this case, a default will be provided that passes the result value through (timriley in [#9](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/pull/9))

[Compare v0.5.0...v0.6.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

## 0.5.0 2016-06-30


### Added

- Added support for building custom matchers, with an any number of match cases, each offering their own matching and resolving logic. This is now the primary API for dry-matcher. (timriley)

  ```ruby
  # Match `[:ok, some_value]` for success
  success_case = Dry::Matcher::Case.new(
    match: -> value { value.first == :ok },
    resolve: -> value { value.last }
  )

  # Match `[:err, some_error_code, some_value]` for failure
  failure_case = Dry::Matcher::Case.new(
    match: -> value, *pattern {
      value[0] == :err && (pattern.any? ? pattern.include?(value[1]) : true)
    },
    resolve: -> value { value.last }
  )

  # Build the matcher
  matcher = Dry::Matcher.new(success: success_case, failure: failure_case)

  # Then put it to use
  my_success = [:ok, "success!"]

  result = matcher.(my_success) do |m|
    m.success do |v|
      "Yay: #{v}"
    end

    m.failure :not_found do |v|
      "Oops, not found: #{v}"
    end

    m.failure do |v|
      "Boo: #{v}"
    end
  end

  result # => "Yay: success!"
  ```

### Changed

- Renamed to `dry-matcher`, since this is now a flexible, general purpose pattern matching API. All components are now available under the `Dry::Matcher` namespace. (timriley)
- `Dry::Matcher.for` requires a matcher object to be passed when being included in a class:

  ```ruby
  MyMatcher = Dry::Matcher.new(...)

  class MyOperation
    include Dry::Matcher.for(:call, with: MyMatcher)

    def call
    end
  end
  ```
- The previous `Dry::ResultMatcher.match` behaviour (for matching `Either` monads) has been moved to `Dry::Matcher::EitherMatcher.call`

[Compare v0.4.0...v0.5.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)

## 0.4.0 2016-06-08


### Added

- Support convertible result objects responding to `#to_either` (ttdonovan)

### Changed

- Expect monads from [dry-monads](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-monads) instead of [Kleisli](https://github.com/txus/kleisli) (ttdonovan)

[Compare v0.3.0...v0.4.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0)

## 0.3.0 2016-03-23


### Changed

- Renamed to `dry-result_matcher`. Match results using `Dry::ResultMatcher.match` or extend your own classes with `Dry::ResultMatcher.for`.

[Compare v0.2.0...v0.3.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

## 0.2.0 2016-02-10


### Added

- Added `EitherResultMatcher.for(*methods)` to return a module wrapping the specified methods (returning an `Either`) with the match block API. Example usage, in a class with a `#call` method: `include EitherResultMatcher.for(:call)`.


[Compare v0.1.0...v0.2.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-matcher/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

## 0.1.0 2015-12-03

Initial release.
